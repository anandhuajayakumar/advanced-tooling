									<h3>Market Strategy</h3>
									<p class="text-left">Today’s struggling economy and shrinking market, makes it imperative for manufacturers’ reps  in conjunction with their manufacturer’s and distributor partners to focus on the “hot” markets in order to grow their business.  In today’s manufacturing industry, very few markets are “hot”, but some of those that are “doing well” are: Aerospace & defense, medical/orthopedic, ship building and repair, small arms, and to a lesser degree the rapidly rebounding mold & die industry.  These markets all share one thing in common: The materials being used are not typically aluminum or low carbon steel. Instead they are titanium and nickel alloys, stainless Steels, composites, and heat treated tool steels.</p>
									<p class="text-left">All of these materials are very difficult and require the kind of experience that the AT&E team provides.  With recent advances in machine tool technologies and cutting tool substrate, edge preps and newer hybrid coatings, the ability to optimize production rates has never been better.</p>
									<p class="text-left">At AT&E, we not only focus on these markets and difficult materials, we “specialize” in them.With our 100+ years of experience “at the spindle”, we can help your company manufacture, grow market share, and ultimately increase profits.</p>
									<p class="text-left">From a supplier and product standpoint, our goal long term is to build a group of supplier partners that, when combined, will offer complete solutions to all of our distributors and end user partners.  By building a strategic product offering mindset, we intend to position ourselves to be uniquely qualified to handle all technical application issues that are required in the day-to-day manufacturing business.</p>

									<h3>Distribution Strategy</h3>
									<p class="text-left">The distribution market in the United States is very uncertain at this point.  Integrated supply combined with a shrinking market has left the industrial distribution base struggling to survive.  This combined with the philosophy of many vendors that “more distribution is better“, has led to the gradual erosion in loyalty of the distribution base in the U.S.</p>
									<p class="text-left">In the West specifically, distributor markets vary tremendously by geographic region. San Diego, for example, has more challenging markets for both distributors and manufacturers despite its size and potential.  On the contrary, the Los Angeles area offers a highly specialized, capable, technical distribution network to choose from. The experience and the relationships of AT&E will assist our supplier partners in navigating these markets, maximizing success, while minimizing the time necessary to reach that level.</p>
									<p class="text-left">There are fewer distributors that are technically capable of selling high tech products.  Too many manufacturers choose to add distribution in difficult times when in reality they should reduce the number of distributors and reward those that have performed.  It is important to remember that, as a manufacturer, your “rep” is your face to distribution.  As distributor sales personnel’s effective sales time is limited, they typically only support product lines that support them in return.  We strive to build a sales network through limited, select, highly technical distributors that will allow us to demand the time of the “right” distributors by providing tremendous support along with the loyalty lacking in many relationships.</p>
